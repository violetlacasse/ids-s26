## Effective Data Science Communication

This section is by Abby White, a senior majoring in Statistical Data Science 
with a concentration in Advanced Statistics.

### Introduction

Data science communication is about more than presenting results; it is about 
helping others understand and act on them. A clear visualization, a well-phrased 
sentence, or a reproducible workflow can determine whether your analysis makes 
an impact or gets lost in translation.

In this presentation, I will discuss:  
1. Why communication matters in data science.  
2. Key principles for clarity and transparency.  
3. How visualization and storytelling improve understanding.  
4. The role of reproducibility and ethics in reporting results.  
5. How to connect insights to action.  

### Why Communication Matters

Even the best analysis doesn't mean much if people cannot understand it. 
Clarity, honesty, and reproducibility are what make results useful.


#### Example: Framing a Finding Clearly

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the cleaned NYC crash data
crash_df = pd.read_feather("../ids-s26/data/nyc_crashes_cleaned.feather")

# Count crashes by borough
borough_counts = crash_df["borough"].value_counts().reset_index()
borough_counts.columns = ["borough", "crash_count"]

sns.barplot(
    data=borough_counts,
    x="borough", y="crash_count",
    order=borough_counts.sort_values("crash_count", ascending=False)["borough"],
)
plt.title("NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions by Borough (Labor Day Week, 2025)")
plt.xlabel("Borough")
plt.ylabel("Crash Count")

# Add labels above bars
for i, val in enumerate(borough_counts["crash_count"]):
    plt.text(i, val + (0.01 * borough_counts["crash_count"].max()),
             f"{val:,}", ha="center", fontsize=9)

# Add 5% headroom above the tallest bar
plt.ylim(0, borough_counts["crash_count"].max() * 1.05)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This bar chart shows total crashes by borough. Without labels, the pattern is
visible but vague. Adding numbers and sorting by count makes the trend clear.
Brooklyn and Queens lead due to population and road density.

Visuals that highlight why something happens, not just that it happens,
communicate far more effectively.

>Poor phrasing:  
    "Brooklyn has the highest number of crashes."

>Better phrasing:  
    "During Labor Day week 2025, Brooklyn recorded the most motor vehicle 
    collisions, followed by Queens and Manhattan. This pattern likely reflects 
    each borough's larger population, higher traffic volume, and denser road 
    networks."

The first sentence is technically correct but empty of insight. The second 
version connects data to why it matters. It is specific, comparative, and 
interpretable. 

Good communication translates data into meaning. When presenting findings, 
always lead with a clear takeaway before showing details.

### Clarity and Context

Clarity comes from balancing accuracy with accessibility. The goal is to make 
complex analysis understandable without oversimplifying it.

Guidelines for clear communication:  
- Lead with the main takeaway before showing details.  
- Define all technical terms (e.g., "injury severity index").  
- Provide relative comparisons, not just counts.  
- Add short interpretations under visuals.

#### Example: Turning Output into Insight

```{python}
# Calculate the average number of people injured per crash by borough
injury_summary = (
    crash_df.groupby("borough")["number_of_persons_injured"]
    .mean()
    .sort_values()
)
injury_summary
```

>Technical phrasing:  
    "Mean injuries per crash differ by borough."

>Clear phrasing:  
    "On average, crashes in the Bronx result in the highest injury rates (about 
    0.8 people injured per crash), while Staten Island has the lowest (around 
    0.56). Differences are modest but suggest slightly greater crash severity 
    in more densely populated areas."

The first phrasing is correct but vague. It does not tell the audience how or by 
how much boroughs differ. The clearer version adds real numbers, ranks, and a hint 
of interpretation (density and traffic volume). Good phrasing gives context so 
the audience immediately grasps what the data shows.

To make this pattern easier to see visually:

```{python}
sns.barplot(
    x=injury_summary.values,
    y=injury_summary.index,
    color="steelblue"  # same color for all bars
)
plt.title("Average Injuries per Crash by Borough")
plt.xlabel("Average Number of Injured People")
plt.ylabel("Borough")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The bar chart shows that the Bronx leads with the highest average injuries per 
crash, while Staten Island has the lowest. Clear labeling, ordered categories, 
and a clean layout make the trend easy to interpret without visually 
exaggerating small differences.

### Visual Storytelling

Visuals are often the clearest way to communicate a pattern. Strong visual 
design helps people notice relationships quickly and remember them longer.

A good graphic should make the takeaway obvious in a few seconds. Titles, 
captions, and color choices all guide the audience toward what matters most.

#### Example: Highlighting a Trend

```{python}
# Make sure datetime is parsed
crash_df["crash_datetime"] = pd.to_datetime(
    crash_df["crash_datetime"], errors="coerce"
)

# Group by day 
daily = (
    crash_df.groupby(crash_df["crash_datetime"].dt.date)
    .size()
    .reset_index(name="count")
    .rename(columns={"crash_datetime": "date"})
)

# Convert date column back to datetime64[ns] for plotting
daily["date"] = pd.to_datetime(daily["date"])

sns.lineplot(
    data=daily.sort_values("date"),
    x="date",
    y="count",
    marker="o"
)

plt.title("Daily NYC Crashes (Labor Day Week, 2025)")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Crash Count")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
# plt.ylim(bottom=0) # <- y-axis starts at 0
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This line chart shows how crash frequency changed across Labor Day week 2025.
The dataset covers a short time window, so we see day-to-day variation rather 
than long-term trends. Clear labeling and a simple layout make the pattern 
easy to interpret without overstating the limited time frame.

A clear title, readable x-axis, and minimal clutter make the trend easy to 
interpret.

> A short caption might read:  
"Daily crash counts fluctuate slightly over the observed period, reflecting normal 
day-to-day variation in traffic volume."

That single sentence turns a small snapshot of data into an understandable story
without overstating what the time range can show. Once we understand how visuals 
convey meaning, the next step is choosing the chart type that best fits our data.

### Choosing the Right Chart Type

Selecting the right chart is just as important as making it look clean. The 
wrong type can hide a pattern or even mislead the audience, while the right 
one highlights exactly what matters.

When deciding how to visualize data, start with the question you want to 
answer. Every chart should answer one specific question rather than trying to 
show everything at once. Different chart types serve different purposes:  

**Compare Categories:**  
- Chart: Bar or column chart  
- Example: Average injuries per crash by borough shows differences clearly
  without exaggeration.

**Show Change Over Time:**  
- Chart: Line chart  
- Example: Daily or hourly crash counts reveal rush-hour spikes or weekend dips.

**Display Proportions:**  
- Chart: Pie or stacked bar chart  
- Example: Percent of crashes involving pedestrians vs. motorists shows
  relative risk.

**Reveal Relationships:**  
- Chart: Scatter plot  
- Example: Plotting vehicle speed vs. injury severity could show how risk
  increases with speed.

**Show Distributions:**  
- Chart: Histogram or box plot  
- Example: A histogram of crash times shows when collisions are most
  common across a day.

These choices matter because each chart highlights a specific relationship 
between variables. For instance, the line chart of hourly injuries works better 
than a bar chart because it emphasizes flow and continuity across time. 
Conversely, comparing borough averages suits a bar chart since categories are 
discrete.

When in doubt, simplicity and intent guide good design. Avoid flashy visuals or 
3D effects that distract from the message. Instead, use consistent colors, clear 
labels, and honest axes to help the audience see what you want them to see.

### Reproducibility and Transparency

Reproducibility builds trust in your analysis. Transparent workflows including 
data sources, software versions, and assumptions, allow others to verify and 
extend your work. In data science, reproducibility isn't just about rerunning 
code; it's about clear communication of process.

Good practices for transparency:  
- Combine code and writing in a single Quarto or Jupyter file.  
- Record where and when data was retrieved.  
- Comment on all major data-cleaning steps.  
- Use readable variable names and consistent file structure.

#### Example: Adding Reproducible Metadata

```{python}
# Data source: NYC Open Data (accessed October 2025)
# File: ids-f25/data/nyc_crashes_cleaned.feather
# Environment: Python 3.11 | pandas 2.2 | seaborn 0.13

print(crash_df.info())
```

Including the info() output and environment details helps document your data's
structure. Anyone revisiting your project can quickly see how the dataset was
formatted and what columns were used. This kind of metadata makes collaboration 
and replication straightforward.

### Ethical and Responsible Communication

Ethical communication means presenting your data truthfully and clearly. When 
data visuals or summaries are misleading, even unintentionally, they can 
distort public understanding. Effective communicators focus on honesty and clarity.

Common pitfalls:  
- Cropping or compressing axes to exaggerate trends.  
- Omitting missing data or uncertainty.  
- Implying causation when showing correlation.  

Better habits:  
- Start axes at zero when showing counts.  
- Provide notes or error ranges when possible.  
- Write captions that clarify context and limitations.

#### Example 1: Cropped Axis

```{python}
# Example 1: Cropped Axis
ymin = borough_counts["crash_count"].min()
ymax = borough_counts["crash_count"].max()
second_lowest = sorted(borough_counts["crash_count"])[1]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(7, 7))

# Misleading chart (top)
sns.barplot(
    data=borough_counts,
    x="borough",
    y="crash_count",
    ax=axes[0],
    color="steelblue"
)
axes[0].set_ylim(second_lowest * 0.9, ymax * 1.02)
axes[0].set_title("Misleading Chart: Axis Cropped Too High")
axes[0].set_xlabel("")
axes[0].set_ylabel("Crash Count")
axes[0].tick_params(axis="x", rotation=45)

# Honest chart (bottom)
sns.barplot(
    data=borough_counts,
    x="borough",
    y="crash_count",
    ax=axes[1],
    color="steelblue"
)
axes[1].set_ylim(0, ymax * 1.02)
axes[1].set_title("Honest Chart: Axis Starts at Zero")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Borough")
axes[1].set_ylabel("Crash Count")
axes[1].tick_params(axis="x", rotation=45)

plt.tight_layout(pad=2)
plt.show()
```

When the y-axis is cropped so it starts just below the smaller bars, Brooklyn's
crash count looks dramatically higher than the other boroughs. The honest
version, which starts the y-axis at zero, shows that the differences are real
but not as extreme. This demonstrates how axis limits can exaggerate scale, even
when the underlying data is unchanged. 

#### Example 2: Distorted Aspect Ratio

```{python}
# Example 2: Distorted Aspect Ratio
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3.5))

sns.lineplot(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
             ax=axes[0], marker="o")

axes[0].set_box_aspect(1.8)  # misleading proportions
axes[0].set_title("Misleading: Distorted Aspect Ratio")
axes[0].set_xlabel("Time")
axes[0].set_ylabel("Value")

sns.lineplot(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
             ax=axes[1], marker="o")
axes[1].set_box_aspect(1)  # normal proportions
axes[1].set_title("Honest: Equal Scaling")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Time")
axes[1].set_ylabel("Value")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Changing the aspect ratio alters the apparent steepness of trends.
The left plot exaggerates change by compressing the x-axis, while the right plot
uses consistent scaling to display the real rate of change. Aspect distortion
is subtle but powerful, it can make normal variation seem dramatic.

#### Example 3: Misleading Color Emphasis

```{python}
# Example 3: Misleading Color Emphasis

# Sample data 
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "borough": ["Brooklyn", "Queens", "Manhattan", "Bronx"],
    "crash_rate": [8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5]
})

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 3))

# Misleading chart: overemphasized colors 
sns.barplot(
    data=data,
    x="borough",
    y="crash_rate",
    hue="borough",
    palette=["darkred", "red", "salmon", "pink"],
    legend=False,
    ax=axes[0]
)
axes[0].set_title("Misleading: Color Overemphasis")

# Honest chart: consistent, neutral color
sns.barplot(
    data=data,
    x="borough",
    y="crash_rate",
    color="steelblue",
    ax=axes[1]
)
axes[1].set_title("Honest: Neutral Colors")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Color choices can easily mislead. The chart on the left uses intense red tones to
suggest large differences between boroughs, even though the variation is small.
The right chart uses a neutral palette to draw attention to data values instead
of emotional cues.

Ethical visualization respects the audience's ability to interpret data fairly.
This connects to the broader issue of abusing a plot which involves using 
design choices to distort perception. Such misuse can involve altering aspect 
ratios, exaggerating colors, omitting context, or adjusting baselines to 
amplify change. True integrity in visualization means clarity over drama. We 
should show data as it is, not as we wish it looked.

### Connecting Insights to Action

Great communication doesn't stop at describing what happened, it explains what 
should happen next. Visuals paired with short, concrete takeaways make insights 
actionable.

#### Example: Turning Findings into Decisions

```{python}
# Filter crashes with any injuries (pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists)
injury_df = crash_df[
    (crash_df["number_of_pedestrians_injured"] > 0)
    | (crash_df["number_of_cyclist_injured"] > 0)
    | (crash_df["number_of_motorist_injured"] > 0)
].copy()

# Extract hour of day
injury_df["hour"] = injury_df["crash_datetime"].dt.hour

# Create a combined total injury column
injury_df["total_injuries"] = (
    injury_df["number_of_pedestrians_injured"]
    + injury_df["number_of_cyclist_injured"]
    + injury_df["number_of_motorist_injured"]
)

# Group by borough and hour
injuries_by_hour = (
    injury_df.groupby(["borough", "hour"])["total_injuries"]
    .sum()
    .reset_index()
)

# Plot total injuries by hour for each borough
sns.lineplot(
    data=injuries_by_hour,
    x="hour",
    y="total_injuries",
    hue="borough",
    marker="o"
)
plt.title("Hourly Injuries (Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists) by Borough")
plt.xlabel("Hour of Day")
plt.ylabel("Total Injuries")
plt.xticks(range(0, 24, 2))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This plot shows how total traffic-related injuries (pedestrians, cyclists, and 
motorists combined) change by hour in each borough. Injuries stay relatively 
low overnight, then rise during the afternoon and peak in the late day and early 
evening; most noticeably in Brooklyn and Queens, with a smaller but similar 
bump in the Bronx and Manhattan. Staten Island stays consistently lower overall.
These rush-hour spikes line up with high activity on the roads where there are 
more cars, more people moving, and more chances for conflict. That suggests a 
clear intervention window.

> "Injuries across Brooklyn and Queens jump in the late afternoon and evening, 
which lines up with commuting traffic. Targeted enforcement, traffic calming, 
and signal timing changes during these peak hours could help reduce harm."

Here, the analysis leads directly to a recommendation. That bridge from insight
to action turns analysis into impact. Communicating findings this way helps
decision-makers use data effectively.

### Recommendations for Effective Communication and Presentation

Good data communication does not end with a well-designed chart. It extends to 
how findings are framed, timed, and delivered. Clear, focused communication helps 
turn technical results into insights that people can actually use.

#### General Recommendations

- Lead with purpose by explaining why the data matters before discussing details.  
- Show the story, not the spreadsheet, visuals should clarify, not overwhelm.  
- Keep design elements consistent so colors, scales, and fonts feel cohesive.  
- Anticipate how non-technical audiences might interpret results and add context 
  when needed.  
- Connect each chart or finding to its real-world relevance or next steps.  

#### Being Time-Aware

- Know your total time and plan the pacing of your talk accordingly.  
- Prioritize the most important findings, it's better to explain a few points 
  clearly than to rush through many.  
- Practice transitions between sections so the flow feels natural and on schedule.  
- Keep visuals simple so they can be understood quickly without overexplaining.  
- Leave a few minutes for questions or discussion at the end if possible.  
- If you run short on time, skip details that don't change the main takeaway.  

#### Giving a Strong Presentation

- Start with a clear message so your audience knows what to expect.  
- Guide the audience through each visual: what to notice and why it matters.  
- Keep slides uncluttered, focusing on one key idea at a time.  
- Speak at a steady pace, pausing briefly after key visuals to let points sink in.  
- Avoid jargon and tailor explanations to your audience's background.  
- End with a short summary that reinforces the main insight and next step.  

Delivering data effectively means combining clarity, timing, and empathy for 
your audience. When visuals, pacing, and delivery align, data becomes insight 
rather than just information.

### Conclusion

Effective data science communication blends clarity, accuracy, reproducibility, 
and ethics. When practiced together, these elements transform complex analyses 
into stories people can understand and act on.

The NYC crash dataset shows how  simple design, transparent documentation, and 
ethical framing make results meaningful far beyond the numbers.
